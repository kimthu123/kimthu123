## 🌟 About Me

I'm Jace — a curious and adaptable Software Development student who enjoys turning ideas into working products.  
I love exploring how **AI tools, JavaScript, automation scripts, and modern developer tooling** can make development faster and more enjoyable.

I learn best by **building**, **breaking things**, and **trying again**.  
My projects reflect how I like to work: simple ideas, clean execution, real impact.
