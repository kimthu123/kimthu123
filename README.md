## 🌟 About Me

Hi! I'm Jace — a curious and determined software student who learns by trying, breaking, fixing, and laughing through the process 😆  
I love building things that feel simple, helpful, and a little bit magical ✨.

Right now, I'm a **Software Development student actively looking for my first job or internship** to grow, contribute, and learn from real industry environments.  
I’ve never been the “lucky” type, so I rely on **consistency, grit, and a stubborn work ethic** to get where I want to be.

### A few quick things about me:
- 🧠 I love exploring how AI can speed up learning and coding.
- 🌱 I grow by building small things every week.
- 🐢 I'm persistent — even when progress is slow, I keep showing up.
- ☕ I function on coffee, curiosity, and good playlists.
- 🧩 I solve problems the same way I play puzzles: piece by piece, calmly.
